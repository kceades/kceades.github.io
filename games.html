<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
<p>Care to try your hand at the classic game? You can play solo vs the computer or against an opponent taking turns clicking on the board. Good luck!</p>
<p>The AI here is a N-ply lookahead algorithm, which is set to 9-ply (the maximum) but can be changed. Also note that changes can only be made after or before a game is played.</p>

<h2>Connect 4</h2>
<p>Again, you can play solo vs the computer or against an opponent taking turns clicking on the board. Good luck!</p>
<p>Quite similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, the AI here is a N-ply lookahead algorithm, which is set to 9-ply (but takes a bit to run) but can be lowered. Also note that changes can only be made after or before a game is played.</p>
