<h1>November 11, 2017: Quick Comments on JavaScript</h1>

<p>Over a couple hours of debugging and searching the interwebs for answers, I learned a few important things about JavaScript that I wouldn't have necessarily expected coming from mainly coding in Python. While I have also had C++ and Java experience several years ago, it'd been a while since writing anything in a language similar to this.</p>

<h3>Lesson 1</h3>

<p>Consider the following example. Set</p>

<p>var x = [[0,1],[1,1],[2,7]];</p>

<p>That is, let x be a variable that is a nested array. Now set</p>

<p>var y = x;</p>

<p>Here, JavaScript, like many languages, thinks you want to copy the references for some reason, which has always seemed unnatural to me. In Python, something like y=np.copy(x) works, but with nested arrays in JavaScript, you have to loop through the arrays. At least for singly nested arrays like the one above, a solution is fairly straightforward.</p>

<p>The solution I found on the interwebs that worked for me is</p>

<p>var y = x.map(function(arr) {return arr.slice();});</p>

<h3>Lesson 2</h3>

<p>You cannot simply pass an array to Math.min or Math.max. Instead, if x is a non-nested array, then use</p>

<p>var max_x = Math.max.apply(null,x);</p>
