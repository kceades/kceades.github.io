<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>Here, you can take a look at the type of work I do as a physicist, as well as some of the side projects I've worked on from time to time.</p>

<div class='preview'>
<h1>Games</h1>
<p>In this section, you can play some browser games that I've written while learning how to code up JavaScript. For now, there is only the infamous Tic-Tac-Toe, but hopefully soon more games will come!</p>

<h1>Blog</h1>
<p>All right, this is where things get a little out of hand. In this section, you can find a blog of dubious existence with random musings.</p>

<h1>Writing</h1>
<p>If you want to read longer, more *hehe* thoughtfully *heh* composed works of mine, this section has some short stories that I wrote for a writing class on short fiction that I took in undergrad. Over time, this may get more populated with short stories, poems, and potentially that novel that I might get around to writing someday (yes, yes, I know everyone out there is getting around to writing their novel someday).</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Come here to check out my resume or curriculum vitae! I'm currently on the market for jobs. Also come for random facts.</p>
