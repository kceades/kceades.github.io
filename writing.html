<h2>Faith</h2>
<p><i>Faith</i> is a dismal tale of a doctor struggling through the banals of being the better person. This was the final project in my class. To read it, click on the pink word 'Faith' above this paragraph.</p>

<h2>Chess</h2>
<p><i>Chess</i> was written as a constraint exercise with the goal of writing a story in exactly 250 words that never used the same word twice. The other option was to not use a certain set of letters: I opted for the non-repeating constraint though because I feel like my writing follows a specific style that wears on itself and its dictionary over a read. It was fun to get creative with sentence structures and vocabulary in general! To read it, click on the pink word 'Chess' above this paragraph.</p>

<h2>A Cinematic Mind</h2>
<p><i>A Cinematic Mind</i> was the first story I wrote in a short fiction class. There were a few constraints, but I have since forgetten what exactly they were. I also was unable to locate the final draft, so this is an earlier version. Not that it ever wound up being any good; just forgive any typos. Without further ado, you know what to do. Click the title above to read: enjoy!</p>
